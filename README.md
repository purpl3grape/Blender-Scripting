# Blender-Scripting
Blender Scripting for workflow. Exporting batched objects based on Naming

Multi Exporter Script
- Since the objects in Blender were nested, having to open each one to select the necessary objects to export as a single FBX object was time consuming

All Mesh Renamer Script
- When creating objects from blender, the names of the object are not exactly linked to each other, so to keep things more organized as opposed to having mesh names with no meaning, and not being tied to object name, just rename all mesh to object name for consistency.
That way in the assets folder for meshes, you can identify what each mesh is and which game object they are associated with.

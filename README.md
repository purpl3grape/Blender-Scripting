# Blender-Scripting
Blender Scripting for workflow. Exporting batched objects based on Naming

- Since the objects in Blender were nested, having to open each one to select the necessary objects to export as a single FBX object was time consuming

- If each nested object has the same unique starting name as the parent object, then the script will look through similar named items and export them as a single FBX
